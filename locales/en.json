Each new detail is presented in an orderly, logical manner.\n    o\tBuilding climax at \"critical points\": When discovering important details (gloves, lipstick marks, contradictory camera data, appearance of twin sister).\n    o\tQuick resolution in investigation conclusion and trial: When the perpetrator is revealed, testimony is presented, and verdict is announced.\n    o\tReflective at the end: Shift to contemplation, offering lessons and messages.\n3.\tStorytelling Style:\n    o\tChronological narrative: Start from case discovery, investigation process, to trial and end with reflections.\n    o\tInterweaving events and analysis: Not just retelling events but incorporating reasoning from investigation agencies and criminal psychology experts.\n    o\tUsing many specific details: Dates, times, locations, identifying characteristics, and evidence described clearly.\n    o\tCreating surprises (plot twists): The appearance of the twin sister is a major surprise element that changes the investigation direction.\n    o\tGuiding readers/listeners through investigator's reasoning: Step by step revealing clues, eliminating suspects, until finding the real perpetrator.\n    o\tEnding with a social message: Not just a simple criminal case but also a lesson about relationships, care, and listening.\n4.\tCharacteristic Phrases:\n    o\tPhrases like: \"Hello dear viewers,\" \"recently in Hanoi,\" \"so what exactly happened,\" \"competent authorities,\" \"scene immediately cordoned off,\" \"preliminary death conclusion,\" \"investigators proceed to examine,\" \"however,\" \"this confirms,\" \"a noteworthy detail,\" \"under psychological pressure,\" \"opening a new investigation direction,\" \"small but consistent details,\" \"from here a new hypothesis is proposed,\" \"first shock,\" \"contradiction forces investigation team,\" \"officially admits guilt,\" \"according to testimony,\" \"verdict not yet announced but truth is clear,\" \"court announces,\" \"case closed... but...,\" \"nagging question.\""
